//! Cutting topology apart without breaking it.
//!
//! Every modelling operation that adds detail ends here: a boolean splits the
//! faces its intersection curves cross, a fillet splits the edges it runs
//! along, and an imprint splits both. What they have in common is that the
//! result has to be as consistent as the input — a face split into two halves
//! that do not quite share their new edge is worse than one not split at all,
//! because it looks finished.
//!
//! So each operation here leaves [`Body::validate`] finding nothing, and the
//! tests check that rather than checking the pieces individually.
//!
//! # The part that is easy to forget
//!
//! An edge belongs to two faces. Splitting it changes the loop of the face
//! being worked on *and* the loop of the one on the other side, which is not
//! mentioned anywhere in the operation's own description and is exactly what
//! a first implementation misses. The far face's loop is then one coedge
//! short, its ring no longer closes, and the failure surfaces later as a
//! boolean that loses a wall.
