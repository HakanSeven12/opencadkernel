//! Where two bounded surfaces meet, tangencies included.
//!
//! [`intersect`](super::intersect) answers for whole surfaces, in closed
//! form or not at all. A face is a bounded piece of a surface, and the pairs
//! no closed form covers are the hard ones: two cylinders at an angle, a
//! spline wall touching a plane along a line, two loops meeting at a point.
//! This module answers for two bounded pieces whatever they are, through the
//! `opencadkernel-ssi` engine: subdivision into rational Bézier pieces, the
//! implicit form of one surface composed with the other's pieces, and a
//! marcher for what is left. It finds crossing curves, curves of tangency,
//! isolated touch points and the points where branches cross, and splits the
//! curves there. What it cannot prove it refuses, never guesses.
//!
//! The engine works on rational B-spline patches. A plane, cylinder, cone,
//! sphere or torus becomes the exact rational patch of that surface over the
//! box asked for, carrying its implicit form; a spline surface goes in as it
//! is. Every point that comes back is given in the kernel's own parameters of
//! each surface (radians, the cone measured from its base circle), so it can
//! go straight into a face's parameter space.
